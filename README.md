# Make.com Scenarios
This repository contains an automation scenario built using Make.com 
Each scenario is designed to automate tasks, save time, and simplify workflows for different use cases.

## What is Make.com?
Make.com is a no-code, or rather low-code, platform that connects apps and services using visual workflows. These scenarios can be reused, customized, and expanded to tailor to your needs. 

## Repository Structure
Each folder contains a scenario with:
- Scenario File (.json) – can be imported directly into Make.com
- Documentation (README.md or notes) – explains the purpose, steps, and setup

Example:
/expense-tracker-alerts  
  ├── scenario.json  
  ├── README.md  
  └── screenshot.png  

/random-quote-email  
  ├── scenario.json  
  ├── README.md

## Requirements
